In December 2022, I decided to shift into web development, embarking on a coding journey and fully transitioning into IT by November 2023. With 7 months of programming experience, I’ve developed a niche in frontend development, working as a full-stack developer at Swift Haulage Berhad. Along the way, I gained expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at Sigma School, interned at ThunderQuote using Vue.js, Pug, and Bootstrap Vue, and built e-commerce platforms at HOMA SDN BHD with React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to deliver impactful solutions.</div>
